# Game of "Cuarenta"
## Overview
The game of "Cuarenta" is a traditional Ecuadorian game specifically from Quito. It can be played between 2 or 4 and the first to reach 40 points wins.
## Rules
- It is a fishing game played with the standard 52 card pack of Anglo-American playing cards, but all 10s, 9s and 8s are omitted (ace is low).
- The number of points ($40$) that are required to win a chica (small division of the game) and also to the number of cards used to play it.
- Two chicas or the first chica with zapater√≠a (loss of the chica by scoring less than ten points) win the game (a completed game is called a "mesa", literally meaning "table", which in this context refers to "match"). The game can be played by 2 players, or 4 players split into two teams. Cuarenta is the national card game of Ecuador and even has official tournaments.
- The score is kept with two kinds of chips, the two-point tantos (points) and the ten-point perros (dogs). When a standard 52 card pack is used, the 8s, 9s and 10s can be used to keep the score.
